# Libnfc_custom_function

Welcome !!! This is a simple tutorial to add a custom function to libnfc. There are two ways of doing it: Add functions directly to the files or create two seprate files that will do just what you need.
I prefer the second one since it keeps things organized and clear.

Here are the links the the files:

[Method 1](Custom_Function_method_1.md)

[Method 2](Custom_function_method_2.md)
